Subject: Re: Your Offer

Dear Professor Petretto,

Thank you so much for your detailed email and for clarifying these important points. I have already submitted all the application materials to HR.

I am very eager to begin contributing to the project and the important groundwork you mentioned. At the same time, I will need to balance finalizing my PhD dissertation in the coming months. In this regard, I have a few specific questions I'd like to discuss with you.

Would it be possible to have some flexibility in the work arrangements, such as the option for remote work when it would be more efficient? I currently live near NTU, and the daily commute to Duke-NUS would take approximately two hours round trip. Having some flexibility would help me maximize productivity during this transition period.

Additionally, I would be grateful if you could recommend some key articles or resources related to our project's research objectives. This would help me start familiarizing myself with the specific context. I have already begun reading the two papers mentioned on the Duke-NUS website's AI-Quantum project page.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I'm looking forward to making meaningful contributions to this exciting project.

Best regards,
Tiesunlong
